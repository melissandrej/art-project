# ART PROJECT / EMOTIONS

This is one of my favorite art pieces I've ever painted. I feel like people could interpreted it in many ways. Depending on your mood; in my opinion.

## Description

At first, I was planning on having a certain amount of triangles and paint them in with specific colors of blue. It didn't came out as I wanted so I decided to paint it over side by side with the same shades of blue that were used before. The different shapes you see on the final result, are just random shapes that popped in my mind, no specifics of where I wanted to put them; all random places. I also used shaving cream; I got this idea from a project for my  printmaking class three semesters ago. I mixed the shaving cream with the paint which added a bit of texture and gave the effect of some of the broken paint strokes throughout the canvas.
